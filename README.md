# Theoretical Introduction and Application of Reinforcement Learning

During my bachelor thesis at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology I implemented Reinforcement Learning algorithm that are foundamental in this area of study. Namely:
* Value Iteration
* Q-Learning

The pokemon jupyter notebook contains the Q-Learning algorithm to find the shortest path to the pokemon as seen below:
